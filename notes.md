# The Inmates are Running the Asylum

- Shipping a bad product in three months is not better
  than shipping a good product in six months. (p. 41)

- When designing software, don't just have a list of features;
  have a plan, and it shouldn't just be to "not crash." (p. 42)

- Users don't really care about features, they only care about achieving their
  goals. Sometimes a feature allows them to do that, but many don't. (p. 47)

- It's wasteful to design software by iterating through many
  versions that users must fight through. (p. 51)

- Throw away the prototype. (p. 57)
